# Privacy-Aware-Social-Application
Privacy Aware Social Application using java

This is a socially intelligent location check-in policy recommender application. A sharing policy such as share with all, share with common friends, and share only with companions for a location check-in depends on multiple contextual attributes, such as the place where you are, the person you are with, the activity you are doing, and so on. Additionally, if you are with someone, the privacy policy for check-in also depends on the preferences of the person you are with. In this project, I have developed a socially aware privacy policy recommender that understands the context you are in, considers preferences of others, and accordingly suggests a sharing policy---share with everyone, share with common friends, share only with people who are together (i.e., present in the same location at the same time), or share with no one. Finally, the application adapts to social expectations and requirements crowdsourced from multiple information sources around you, such that it provides a pleasing social experience.

The code for the entire project is provided here.
